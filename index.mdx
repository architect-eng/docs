The External Actor Gateway (EAG) provides a RESTful API for external systems to integrate with the Architect platform. This API enables third-party applications to programmatically manage brands, page groups, templates, and analytics.

## Getting Started

To begin using the API:

1. **Obtain API credentials** - Contact your account manager to receive an API key
2. **Authenticate requests** - Include your API key in the `x-api-key` header for all requests
3. **Explore the API reference** - Browse the available endpoints in the API Reference tab

## Core Concepts

### Brands
Brands represent your organization's visual identity and theme configuration. Each brand includes:
- Name and company homepage
- Theme customization (light and dark modes)
- Color schemes and logo assets
- Preferred appearance settings

### Page Groups
Page groups are collections of related pages with shared configuration:
- Template assignment
- Business goals and objectives
- URL slugs and titles
- Publication status (draft, published, archived)
- Custom scripts and tracking

### Pages
Individual page variants within a page group, each with:
- Version history
- Statistics and analytics
- UTM parameter tracking
- Session counts

### Templates
Reusable page templates for consistent design:
- System templates (provided by Architect)
- Custom templates (created by your team)
- Template duplication and customization
- Version control

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key:

```bash
curl -X GET 'https://app.tryarchitect.com/api/eag/v0/brands' \
  -H 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429` error response with details about when you can retry.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and returns detailed error responses:

```json
{
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "requestId": "req_01j5k9m7n8p9q2r3s4t5v6w7x8",
  "details": {
    "field": "name",
    "reason": "Name is required"
  }
}
```
